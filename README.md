# JXA Snippets 

A collection of Javascript for Automation (JXA) Snippets for reference and learning. All the code in this repository was run and tested on macOS 10.15.4 Catalina.

## About 

JXA is the Javascript implementation of AppleScript. 

You can drop the files onto the included Applications "Rename js to scpt" and "Rename scpt to js" per your preference. Script Editor can open both file types. 

## Naming

File names start with the App or library they are demonstrating. The exceptions are:  

* Investigate - scripts and features that do not work as expected 
* SA - Scripts demonstrating feature from Standard Additions library 
* Apple ref - copied from [Apple's own guides](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016239-CH56-SW1).
